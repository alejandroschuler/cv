    Thesis: Some Methods to Compare the Real-World Performance of Causal Estimators
 	%{\small I work with Dr. Nigam Shah to translate advancements in electronic health records technology, machine learning, and causal inference to observational clinical studies that will lead to personalized point-of-care treatment recommendations and new evidence-based guidelines. My previous work in the lab has included the development of unsupervised methods for patient phenotype discovery and an application of semi-supervised probabilistic graphical models to extract information from clinical documents.}

    Thesis: Controlled Pattern Formation in a Reaction-Diffusion System: A Novel Application of Non-Linear Model Predictive Control to Distributed Parameters Systems
  %  {\small During my thesis I explored model-predictive control schemes to drive patterned cellular differentiation in systems governed by reaction-diffusion dynamics. During my time working with Dr. Chih-Ming Ho I also studied the algorithmic optimization of combinatorial drug dosages and drug repositioning.}
