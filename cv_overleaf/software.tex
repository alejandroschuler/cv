A Python library that implements Natural Gradient Boosting, as described in "NGBoost: Natural Gradient Boosting for Probabilistic Prediction". It is built on top of Scikit-Learn, and is designed to be scalable and modular with respect to choice of proper scoring rule, distribution, and base learners. My contributions are to the overall design and features of the implementation. 

\href{https://github.com/xnie/rlearner/commits?author=alejandroschuler}{\textbf{rlearner}}\\
An R package implementing the \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.04912.pdf}{R-learner} and other meta-learners for the estimation of heterogenous treatment effects. My code simultaneously extends all of the methods to be compatible with any machine learning algorithm available in the caret package.

\href{https://github.com/madeleineudell/LowRankModels.jl/commits?author=alejandroschuler}{\textbf{LowRankModels.jl}}\\
A julia package for fitting \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0342}{generalized low-rank models}. My contributions include a number of optimizations of the core algorithm and some extensions allowing for different regularization schemes and losses.
